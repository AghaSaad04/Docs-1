## Custom Super Slim ESP 2.4 GHz TX (for lite module bay)

The super slim is an evolution of the slim. It uses the same base hardware as the JR size one. It's the same size as an R9M Lite, and fits in all handsets with a lite module bay such as the X-Lite, X9 Lite, and Tango 2 (with the proper adapter).

## Custom 900 MHz TX (not built anymore)

In the beginning, 900 MHz transmitters were sometimes built DIY. Today they're not. If you have one, the max output power defaults to 100mW, but with `UNLOCK_HIGHER_POWER`, that can be increased to 250mW.
