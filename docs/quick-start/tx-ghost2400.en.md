##Flashing Ghost Modules via STLink

Targets:

- `GHOST_2400_TX_via_STLINK`
- `GHOST_2400_TX_LITE_via_STLINK`

## Initial Flash

Here is a 10 minute video, showing the steps required to both flash the TX if you would rather watch than read:

Flashing the Ghost TX's is currently a **1 WAY** flash once you flash ExpressLRS to the TX you **will not** be able to use it with stock Ghost RX's (running stock firmware, they **will work** while running ELRS).  You will need a `StLink V2` to flash the TX

Wire `3.3v`, `GND`, `CLK`, and `DIO` to their respective pins on your part from the StLink. (You can power with the StLink but in the first two image the radio is used to power the module).

Here is the output/input antennas of the TX:

## Updating

Updating can be done by building an updated version on the configurator and then flashing the `firmware.bin` file using OpenTX.
