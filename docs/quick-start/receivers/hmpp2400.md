## Wiring up your receiver

The image above show the receiver pinout and their connections. As we're dealing with UART connection, Rx on receiver goes to a TX pad in the FC, and Tx on Receiver goes to an uninverted Rx pad on the FC.

!!! note "Note"
    The PP doesn't have a `Boot` pad so there's no need to bridge any pads.

## Configuring your Flight Controller

To configure your flight controller properly, please go through [Configure FC page](configuring-fc.md). These settings apply on INAV, Betaflight and other flight controller software.

Ports Tab should be setup so that Serial RX is on the UART where you have soldered the receiver.

Receiver protocol is `CRSF` with `serialrx_inverted = off` and `serialrx_halfduplex = off`.

The next step will not be able to proceed properly and you'll have issues later if any of these are set differently. Once you have configured your Flight Controller software, close its Configurator and unplug-replug the USB cable from the FC or your computer. This will refresh the connection and you'll be ensured that the port is not busy (of high importance with the Passthrough Flashing Method).

!!! Info 
    The PP receivers do not have Wifi, and so, it can only be updated via Passthrough or STLink(see below).

    1. [Wire] your receiver properly with FC.
    2. Connect the Rx pad on the Receiver to the Tx pad on the FC
    3. Connect the Tx pad on the Receiver to the Rx pad on the FC
    4. Make sure to set up the FC firmware to use CRSF Protocol
    5. Disconnect from Betaflight or INAV Configurator
    6. Close the FC Configurator and unplug the FC from USB
    7. Connect USB or attach a LiPo (if necessary)
    8. If the receiver is getting powered via USB, connect your USB cable to a vacant port.
    10. Select the correct target and set [Firmware Options] using the ExpressLRS Configurator.
    11. **Build & Flash** the firmware using the ExpressLRS Configurator.

    12. Wait for the process to complete, indicated by the "Success" prompt
    13. Power-cycle the FC and verify receiver connects to the Tx module (power up the Tx first, then the Receiver).

    1. Connecting a ST Link to `CLK`, `DIO`, `5V` and `GND`.
    2. Select the correct target and set [Firmware Options] using the ExpressLRS Configurator.
    3. **Build & Flash** the firmware using the ExpressLRS Configurator.

    4. Wait for the process to complete, indicated by the "Success" prompt
    5. Once done, [Wire] your receiver to Flight Controller and you should be ready for the next steps.
