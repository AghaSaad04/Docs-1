**Welcome to the ELRS Quick Start Guide!**

## Prerequisites

Before using this guide, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of navigating through your radio handset firmware (OpenTX/EdgeTX) and setting up models. Additionally, comfort with your Flight Controller firmware (Betaflight, INAV, etc) is also necessary as the guide focuses on setting up your ExpressLRS receiver with your flight controller.

## How to Use or Navigate through the Guide

The ELRS User Guide is designed for both new and experienced users. The Quick Start section can be found on the side navigation and covers the following topics:

- Installing the ExpressLRS Configurator
- Explanation of Options
- Radio and TX module setup
- FC and Receiver setup
- Before you Fly
- Troubleshooting

## Video Guides Availability:
Video guides can become outdated quickly due to the fast pace of development. Specific hardware guides may also use pre-release firmware targets or targets intended for different hardware, which can cause confusion.

A separate video section will be added soon, however, until then, it is recommended to note the publication date of the video to ensure relevance. Currently, the website does not provide video guides.
